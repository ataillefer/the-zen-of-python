## What is this about?

This is a very basic Python coding test.

You have:

 - An implementation class where you must fill the blanks.
 - A `unittest` test class that tells you what is the expected behavior.

The goal is of course to make all unit tests pass!

## How to code and run the tests

The project is composed of 2 simple classes (1 for implementation and 1 for tests) and there are no dependencies, so it should be very simple to make it run.

Simply run the tests with:

    python tester.py

You can edit the implementation with whatever tool you want.

## Rules and expected result 

The goal is to have all unit tests passing.

 - Time: this is not a race, but it is clear that implementation should not take more than 1 hour. 
 - Implementation: of course, having a rather clean implementation does matter (less than 50 lines are actually needed).
 - Dependencies: you should not need to import any specific module other than the Python standard library.
 - Python version: the tests should run with Python 2.7.
